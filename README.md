# Widening Fade-in Animation

I wanted to make a simple sign up animation that when clicked would transform the button into a full details fill-out form.
I learned about adding styles to a class after having done an event such as "Click" on the button to remove the text from the initial button and move it behind the second form and having the second forms text content, fade into view.
