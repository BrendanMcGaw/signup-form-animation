# Widening Fade-in Animation

I wanted to make a simple sign up animation that when clicked would transform the button into a full details fill-out form.
I Learned about adding styles to a class after having done an event such as "Click" to remove the text from the initial button and moving
its z-index number behind the second form and having it fade into view.
